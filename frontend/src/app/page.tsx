        Easily see which laws (public) were passed during any administration.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a presidential administration from the dropdown above.</li>
        <li>
          View all the bills that became law during that president's
          administration, sorted by congress.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Caveats</h2>
      <p>
        While all the laws shown were passed during said president's term, it is
        technically inaccurate to say that all of them were passed by that{" "}
        <em>president</em>. There are instances, although uncommon, in which the
        president vetoed a bill and it was then overriden by congress. Please
        confirm by following the links to the bills in question to determine
        which body of government was ultimately responsible for passing said
        bill.

        </Link>{" "}
        website for congresses prior to the 82nd. Therefore, I've limited the
        choice of administrations to those that began on or after the 82nd
        congress (Harry S. Truman).
